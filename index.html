        <h2>Key Issues</h2>
        <p>Key issues that stand within our country are a lack of border security, lack of education for the new golden generation of Americans, and the lack of activity and transparency in the federal government. Under the Reyes-Edwards administration, we will provide government transparency, not hiding anything from the American people that is vital information. We will nominate and confirm an active Cabinet, with bi-monthly Cabinet meetings and Cabinet reports. Henry Reyes will sign Executive Orders that will start construction of a secure border to fend off illegal immigration and crimes rising from the border. This can all happen with your help and your support. Vote right, vote Reyes for a prosperous America.</p>
